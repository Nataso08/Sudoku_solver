Title: Efficient Sudoku Solver with Optimized Backtracking Algorithm
Description: An efficient and versatile Sudoku solver written in C++ that uses an 
    optimized backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles of any size (9x9, 16x16, 
    25x25, etc.). The solver implements an intelligent backtracking strategy with the 
    MRV (Minimum Remaining Values) heuristic that always chooses the cell with the 
    fewest possible options, resulting in optimal performance.
